# Marketplace-Simulation
 
Author: Max Talwar

This project attempts to simulate a marketplace through an orderbook. Different custom agents can be plugged into the marketplace to interact with it in various ways (for example producers, consumers, speculators, etc), although some agents trade randomly to create the "noise" we would often see in various markets. It's currently a fairly isolated simulation, in the sense that it exists purely to simulate a marketplace. As it improves, though, the long-term vision is to use the marketplace as a tool for broader economics simulations that connects independent economic actors and allows them to trade.
